# Problem Statement
# WeCare insurance company wants to calculate premium of vehicles.
# Vehicles are of two types â€“ "Two Wheeler" and "Four Wheeler". Each vehicle is identified by vehicle id, type, cost and premium amount.
# Premium amount is 2% of the vehicle cost for two wheelers and 6% of the vehicle cost for four wheelers. Calculate the premium amount and display the vehicle details.

# Identify the class name and attributes to represent vehicles. 

# calculate_premium()
# vehicle_cost
# TwoWheeler
# vehicle_type
# vehicle_id
# Vehicle
# premium_amount
# FourWheeler
# premium_percentage
# calculate_vehicle_cost()
# __init__()
# display_vehicle_details()
# Write a Python program to implement the class chosen with its attributes and methods.

# Note:

# Consider all instance variables to be private and methods to be public
# Include getter and setter methods for all instance variables
# Display appropriate error message, if the vehicle type is invalid
# Perform case sensitive string comparison
# Represent few objects of the class, initialize instance variables using setter methods, invoke appropriate methods and test your program.
