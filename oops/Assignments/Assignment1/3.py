# Problem Statement
# A toll booth on the way to Bangalore wants to keep the track of the number of vehicles passed through it and total amount collected by them.
# Write a python program to implement the class diagram given below.

                                 

# Class description:
# Constructor: Initialize both the instance variables, no_of_vehicle, total_amount to 0

# count_vehicle(): Increment total number of vehicle by 1
# calculate_amount(vehicle_type): Accept vehicle type and identify toll amount for that vehicle based on details given in the table. Add it to the total_amount instance variable.
# collect_toll(owner_type,vehicle_type): Accept owner type and vehicle type of the vehicle for which toll should be collected.
# If the owner of the vehicle is a "VIP", then toll amount need not be collected but number of vehicles should be updated.
# For any other type of owner, calculate the toll amount and update the number of vehicles.
# (Hint: Invoke appropriate methods to complete the functionality)
# Perform case insensitive string comparison.
# Create an object of Tollbooth class, invoke collect_toll() method for different vehicles and test your program.
