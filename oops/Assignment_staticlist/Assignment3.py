# Problem Statement
# A company is in the process of providing annual hike to its employees based on incentives and performance of the employee.
# A partial python program has been written for the above requirement, complete the code by using the information and part of class diagram given below:



# Class Description:

# The program has three classes â€“ Company, Employee and PermanentEmployee. Company and Employee classes are already coded for you. Refer starter code.

# Employee class:

# Every employee is given a performance rating (1-3) at the end of every year
# Last five year's performance rating of an employee is stored in the attribute, performance_list
#      Refer table for example and interpretation of data in performance_list, assuming current year is 2015

# Permanent Employee class:

# identify_performance_hike():
# Permanent employees are eligible for performance hike based on their last three years performance as given in table
# Identify the hike % and return it. If hike is not applicable, return None
    

# Performance for last three years

# Hike %


# identify_job_level_hike():
# Permanent employees are eligible for hike based on job level
# Identify job level based hike using the information provided in the Company class and return it. If hike cannot be identified, return None
# identify_incentive():
# Permanent employees are eligible for company level, employee level and permanent employee level incentives
# Calculate total incentive (in Rs) and return it
# calculate_salary(): Calculate total salary
# Implement it in the same way as it is implemented in Employee class
# Note: Perform case sensitive string comparison  
# For testing:

# Create objects of Company class and PermanentEmployee class

# Invoke calculate_salary() on PermanentEmployee object

# Display the details of the employee


class Company:
    # Stores hike% based on job level.
