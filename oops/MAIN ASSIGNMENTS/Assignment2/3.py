# Problem Statement
# Informatica, a consultancy services company has planned to offer cashless transaction service to its employees. The employees can use their smart cards any transaction (credit/debit).
# Write a python program to implement the class diagram given below.



# Class description
# SmartCard class:
#     set_account_balance(account_balance): Initialize account_balance to 500.

# Employee class:

# validate_employee_id(): Employee id should be in the range of 1000 (not inclusive) to 700000(inclusive). If valid return true. Else return false
# validate_card_no(): Validate employee's smart card number.
# Smart card number should have 9 characters
# It should begin with "INF" and
# It should not contain alphabets in any other positions
#     If the above rules are satisfied, return true. Else return false

# Transaction class:

# top_up_card(employee, amount): Accept the object of the employee whose smart card should be topped up with given amount.
# If the given amount is between 500 and 10000 (both inclusive),
# If employee.employee_id and employee.smart_card.card_no are valid, add the given amount to employee.smart_card.account_balance
# Else, return -1
# Else, return -1
# make_payment(employee,amount): Debit the given amount from the employeeâ€™s smart card and auto-generate attribute transaction_id starting with "T" followed by first digit of the employee id and first two numeric values of the card number, if the below rules are satisfied
# Enough balance should be present in employee's smart card
# employee.employee_id and employee.smart_card.account_balance should be valid
# It should be possible to maintain minimum balance of Rs.500 in the smart card even after the transaction is made
#       If any of the above rules are not satisfied, return -1

# Perform case sensitive string comparison.
# Create an object of SmartCard class, create an object of Employee using the SmartCard object.
# Create objects of Transaction class for the Employee object, invoke make_payment() and top_up_card() methods and display the details.
